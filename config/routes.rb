  # resource is singular instead of resources
  # Unlike resources, resource will create routes that do CRUD operation on only one thing.
  # There will be no index routes and no routes will have an :id wildcard. 
  # When using a singular resource, the controller name must still be plural.
  resource :session, only: [:new, :create, :destroy]
  # resources method will generate all CRUD routes following RESTful conventions for a resource. 
  # It will assume there is a controller named after the first argument pluralized and PascalCased.
  # i.e. :question => QuestionsControllers
  resources :questions do 
    # Routes written inside of a block passed to a 'resources' method will be pre-fixed by a path corresponding to the passed in symbol. 
    # In this case all nested routes will be prefixed with '/question/:question_id/'
    resources :answers, only: [:create, :destroy]
  end
  # get('/questions/new', to: 'questions#new', as: :new_question)
  # post('/questions', to: 'questions#create', as: :questions)
  # get('/questions/:id', to: 'questions#show', as: :question)
  # # question_path(<id>), question_url(<id>)
  # get('/questions/:id/edit', to: 'questions#edit', as: :edit_question)
  # # edit_question_path(<id>), edit_question_url(<id>)
  # patch("/questions/:id", to: "questions#update")
  # delete('/questions/:id', to: 'questions#destroy')
  # get('/questions', to: 'questions#index')

  get('/contacts/new', to: 'contact#new' )

  # this defines a `route` rule that says when we recieve a `GET` request with URL `/`, handle it using the `WelcomeController` with `index` action inside that controller
  # The `as` option is used for helper url/path, it overrides or generates helper method that you can use in your views or controllers

  get('/', { to: "welcome#index", as: 'root'} )
