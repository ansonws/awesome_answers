# To generate a factory file for a model, do:
# rails g factory_bot:model job_posts

# FactoryBot.attributes_for :job_post
# Returns a plain hash of the parameters required to create a Job Post

# FactoryBot.build :job_post
# Returns a new un-saved instance of JobPost using the factory

# All your factories must always generate VALID instances of your models. ALWAYS!
FactoryBot.define do
  factory :job_post do
    sequence(:title) { |n| Faker::Job.title + " #{n}" }
    description { Faker::Job.field }

    min_salary { rand 80_000..200_000 }
    max_salary { rand 170_000..400_000 }
    # This line below will create a user (using a user factory) before creating the job post. 
    # Then it will associate that user to the job post.
    # This is necessary to pass the validation added by 'belongs_to :user'
    association(:user, factory: :user)
    # If the factoy has the same name as the association, you can shorten this line to:
    # user
