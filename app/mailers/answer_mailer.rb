class AnswerMailer < ApplicationMailer
    # To generate a mailer, do:
    # rails g mailer <name_mailer>

    # In a Mailer class, the public methods are used to create and send mail. They're similar to actions in a controller.

    # To read more about mailers:

    # To send mail, do the following:
    # AnswerMailer.hello_world.deliver_now
    def hello_world
        mail(
            to: "steve@codecore.ca",
            from: "info@awesome-answer.io",
            cc: "jj@movies.com",
            bcc: "someone.else@example.com",
            subject: "Hello, World!"
        )
    end

    # To deliver this mail, do the following:
    # AnswerMailer.new_answer(Answer.last).deliver_now
    def new_answer(answer)
        # Any instance variable set in a mailer will be available in its rendered templates.
        @answer = answer
        @question = answer.question
        @question_owner = @question.user

        mail(
            to: @question_owner.email,
            from: "info@awesome-answer.io",
            subject: "#{answer.user.first_name} answered your question"
