    # `has_many` can take a `through` named argument to create a many-to-many relationship via another `has_many` declaration.

    # We specify the name of another `has_many` with the `through` option which corresponds to the join table between the two tables that share the many-to-many relationship.

    # We must also provide a `source` named argument to specify which model we're getting back from the many-to-many relationship.

    has_secure_password 
    # Provides user authentication features on the model that it is called in. 
    # It requires a column named 'password_digest' and the gem 'bcrypt'
    # It will add two attribute accessors for 'password' and 'password_confirmation'.
    # It will add a presence validation for the 'password' field.
    # It will save passwords assigned to 'password' using bcrypt to hash and store it in the 'password_digest' column, meaning we will never store plain text passwords.
    # It will add a method named 'authenticate' to verify a user's password. If called with the correct password, it will return the User, otherwise it will return false.
    # The attr_accessor 'password_confirmation' is optional. 
    # But, if it is present, a validation will verify that it is identical to the 'password' attr_accessor
    # For more details:
